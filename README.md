# Online-Store

Welcome to the **Online Store** CLI project! This is a simple command-line application where users can browse products, add them to a shopping cart, and check out using a clean and interactive text-based interface.

##  Project Overview

The **Online Store** app reads inventory data from a `products.csv` file and allows users to:

- View all available products
- Search or filter products by **name**, **price**, or **department**
- Add and remove products from their shopping cart
- Proceed to checkout and view a receipt (with change calculated)
- Save the receipt to a text file
